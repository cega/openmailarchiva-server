# What is this?

This project is a fork of MailArchiva Open Source Edition hosted on sourceforge.net, the URL of which is shown below:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openmailarchiva/

# Why?

## Why fork?

Two reasons. The one reason is they seem to have stopped updating the Open Source Edition. The other is the Enterprise Edition has many advanced features, which is great, but I just need a few of them. So why not implement them by myself?

## Why Github?

Most developer folks around me use Github but not sf.
