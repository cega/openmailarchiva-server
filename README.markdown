# What is this?

This project is a fork of MailArchiva Open Source Edition hosted on sourceforge.net, the URL of which is shown below:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openmailarchiva/

# Why?

## Why fork?

The Enterprise Edition has many advanced features, which is great. But I just need one or two of them, and it seems natural to me to implement them by myself, which I hope won't take too long.

## Why Github?

Most developer folks around me use Github but not sf.

# License

GPL

dunno about the version though... Ask the author of the original version if you need. The same license/version applies to this forked version, of course.
